# Word-Guess-Game
The purpose of this program is to create a word guessing game

I picked a South Park theme: That has the user identify a South Park Character that has been blacked out.



1. I have Displayed the following on the page:

2.  Press any key to get started!

3. Wins: (# of times user guessed the word correctly).

   * If the word is `madonna`,it is displayed like this when the game starts: `_ _ _ _ _ _ _`.

   * As the user guesses the correct letters, they are revealed to them: `m a d o _  _ a`.

4. Number of Guesses Remaining: (# of guesses remaining for the user).

5. Letters Already Guessed: (Letters the user has guessed, displayed like `L Z Y H`).

6. After the user wins/loses the game should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

In order to play the game simply choose a letter to start the game and guess the character.

Good Luck!!

Also by clicking on my page you agree to the fine print that is attached to my page, unfortunately for you I hid it microscopicly inside the background image, good luck finding it because I will hold you to it. Enjoy the hunt :)
